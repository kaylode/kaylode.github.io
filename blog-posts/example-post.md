# My First Real Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is an example of how to create blog posts using markdown files.

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a markdown file in the `blog-posts` directory
2. Add frontmatter with your post metadata
3. Write your content in markdown
4. Run the script to add it to your blog

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- `Code snippets`
- [Links](https://example.com)

### Code Blocks

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning of my blogging journey!
