    "abstract": "Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks.",

    "abstract": "Innovative approaches are needed for managing risk and system change in healthcare. This paper presents a case study of a project that took place over two years, taking a systems approach to managing the risk of healthcare acquired infection in an acute hospital setting, supported by an Access Risk Knowledge Platform which brings together Human Factors Ergonomics, Data Science, Data Governance and AI expertise. Evidence for change including meeting notes and use of the platform were studied. The work on the project focused on first systematically building a rich picture of the current situation from a transdisciplinary perspective. This allowed for understanding risk in context and developing a better capability to support enterprise risk management and accountability. From there a linking of operational and risk data took place which led to mapping of the risk pattern in the hospital.",

Our work focuses on addressing two key challenges in the medical fields, data imbalance and the variety of data types, in order to boost the performance of machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we also employ SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) value visualization to interpret the model predictions and identify both the key data features and disease codes associated with readmission risks, identifying a specific set of diagnosis codes that are significant predictors of readmission within 30 days.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and treatment of vocal fold disorders heavily rely on the use of laryngoscopy. A comprehensive vocal fold diagnosis requires accurate identification of crucial anatomical structures and potential lesions during laryngoscopy observation. However, existing approaches have yet to explore the joint optimization of the decision-making process, including object detection and image classification tasks simultaneously. In this study, we provide a new dataset, VoFoCD, with 1724 laryngology images designed explicitly for object detection and image classification in laryngoscopy images. Images in the VoFoCD dataset are categorized into four classes and comprise six glottic object types.",

Hence, this study introduces a novel dataset focusing on vocal fold images. Additionally, we propose a lightweight network utilizing knowledge distillation, with our student model achieving around 98.4% accuracy-comparable to the original EfficientNetB1 while reducing model weights by up to 88%. We also present an AI-assisted smartphone solution, enabling a portable and intelligent laryngoscopy system that aids laryngoscopists in efficiently targeting vocal fold areas for observation and diagnosis. To sum up, our contribution includes a laryngeal image dataset and a compressed version of the efficient model, suitable for handheld laryngoscopy devices.",
